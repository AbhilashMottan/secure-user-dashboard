React + TypeScript + Vite Project

Overview:
This project is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It demonstrates the use of modern front-end development technologies for building fast and interactive user interfaces with high developer experience. This project was configured with an emphasis on best practices, type safety, and modern development tooling.

Key Features:
React (v18.3) for building reusable UI components.
TypeScript for static typing and reducing runtime errors.
Vite as the modern development server for incredibly fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
ESLint integrated for maintaining code quality and enforcing code consistency.

Getting Started:
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
Development

To start the development server, run:
npm run dev
This will start a local server using Vite with hot module replacement, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

Building for Production:
To create a production build, run:
npm run build
This command will output optimized and minified files to the dist directory.

ESLint Configuration:
Type-Aware Linting
To maintain the highest quality standards, this project utilizes a type-aware ESLint setup. The configuration has been expanded to include rules that understand TypeScript types, improving static analysis and ensuring type safety. Here are some of the highlights:

Type-Aware Lint Rules: The configuration uses tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked to enable lint rules that go beyond basic syntax checking.
React Plugin: eslint-plugin-react is used to provide React-specific linting rules.
Configuration Example:
The ESLint configuration has been updated to support advanced TypeScript checks, as well as stylistic and functional React linting rules. Below is a summary:

js:
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react';

export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
});

Plugins and Features
React Fast Refresh: Enabled by @vitejs/plugin-react or @vitejs/plugin-react-swc for quick feedback during development.
Strict Type Checking: The configuration includes tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked for a more robust linting experience, preventing common issues before they occur.
Why Vite?
Vite is chosen for its incredibly fast HMR, simplifying the development experience while allowing a quick feedback loop. It offers a significant speed advantage over traditional development servers, especially when working with TypeScript and large codebases.

Technology Stack
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that provides type safety and helps catch errors early.
Vite: A next-generation front-end tool for faster and leaner development experience.
ESLint: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code to improve quality.
React Router: For handling client-side routing and navigation.
Code Quality and Standards
ESLint: Ensures that all the code adheres to defined style guides and rules for consistency.
TypeScript: Reduces runtime errors and ensures type correctness across the entire project.
React Best Practices: Utilizes hooks for component state and side-effects, functional components, and clear separation of concerns.
